# Agent observability with QualifireðŸ”¥

## Overview
Modern AI applications increasingly rely on sophisticated, multi-step AI agents. These agents often involve multiple LLM calls, interactions with various tools, and complex decision-making processes. Gaining clear visibility into these intricate workflows is a significant challenge. On top of all of that you might also encounter hallucinations, poor tool selection quality and other AI related risks.
